# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Duration:
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes
### Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

-	Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize correlations between variables via heat maps, impute missing data with the mean values throughout, and identify outliers using boxplots.
-	Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette score and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.
-Furthermore, using the optimal amount of clusters we ran Kmeans clustering and applied the 3 most impactful principal components to plot a 3d scatter plot showing the variance and distribution of the clusters based on the 3 main principal components used.

*an important note: Clustering in this data set are formed based on similarity of the data points, this would indicate that these grocery companies are spending similar amounts on different grocery related products. This could also be indicitive of similar spending patterns of customers which would mean that certain wholesale sales that have little variance and that are clustered together are staple items in a household (milk, detergent products etc) or very popular among their customers etc. 


The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions on wholesale data based on the business questions asked.
